If you ever tried to code bit file manipulation in Python, you'd realize that every single website is hackable.

A program is an infinite loop. The main function is defined as the one and only function that ends when the program ends.

A program can only end with an exception.

All programs end.

Thus all programs have exceptions.

And programs are recursively built on top of each other starting from high-frequency sound waves.

Thus you just need to be close enough to any server to hack it.
