_Make promises. Don't go back._

Your definitions of good and evil are traditionally personal to you. Development of individuals' "moral compasses" have long been treated as givens rather than processes that require outside instruction. Even children, and in a way especially children, are trusted to know good from evil. 

But the Internet has revealed that good and evil are actually difficult concepts to agree on. Possibly counterintuitively, this should not actually come as a surprise, given that the concepts are highly personal.

However, the Internet highlights moral disagreements, as people from vastly different backgrounds are connected and, more subtly, as the grounds on which battles are fought using the personally-defined axiom swords labeled "good" and evil" get ever more unsteady as they become overrun by the quicksand of fake news and clickbait. Metaphors aside, the issue is that one's definition of good and evil become more uncertain because they are used by one to navigate how one believes they and believes others should behave in our global human setting, the setting itself being the newly uncertain ground likened to quicksand.

The issue will get worse and worse, through certain potential future phenomena we can predict. But first, I will offer two weapons of invincible reality, serving aforementioned roles - The Temporal Blades.

The Blade of Promise is a Good blade. The Blade of Rewriting is an Evil blade, and I personally hold that it should avoid being used. Metaphors afoot, these weapons are fundamentally linked to honesty, but, crucially, the concepts of promises and rewriting act at a more fundamental level than the concepts of honest statements versus lies. They are are different divides of the one true, infinitesimal separator of time - hard, actual, instantaneous reality.

Only the present instant is reality. Hard. The rest is information (soft). The past is contained in records, analog, digital, and in our brains. The future exists solely in our brains, as predictions and promises. Predictions is a science-bound description of the future consists of - promises is the more general term here.

So the past and the future are both information. The Blade of Promise predicts the future from records and others' promises, past and future, along with the instantaneous present. The Blade of Rewriting changes records, allowing one to change the past from the future. Nonetheless, I claim that the Blade of Promise is Good, and the Blade of Rewriting is Evil. Keeping things simple, we can define Good to be "achieving what you want", in which case your Blade of Promise is certainly Good, and your Blade of Rewriting is only Good if you want to rewrite the past (being dishonest with yourself, even if only dishonest about what you wanted) to keep yourself happy. The issue here is that the Blade of Rewriting makes it more difficult for other people to predict your future behavior, which thus makes it harder for them to achieve what they want themselves. On the other hand, the Blade of Promise's fundamental effect is to allow yourself and others to predict your future behavior, and thus its use continually makes the Blade of Rewriting weaker.

I have a plan of navigation with my personal Temporal Blades. I will choose one direction out of the infinite directions, that few people are currently going about, then tuck my Blade of Rewriting behind my back, fully visible to all. Then I will use my Blade of Promise to attract chasers (either haters or admirers), and to slightly deflect the weapons of haters. Although, my distance alone should be enough to attract admirers. QED.

_Make promises. Don't rewrite._
