title: 'Why the 4.0 Scale is a Terrible Grading System (and how to fix it)

*Note: I am basing my judgements on the education system in the United States, as that is what I have experienced first-hand. Although education systems differ around the world, I believe many of the concepts I discuss are applicable universally.*

Having been a student for the majority of my life, I understand the pressures associated with grades. In middle school, the pressure came from your parents who expected high scores. In high school, the pressure shifts to something that seems more important for your future: getting into college. But when you finally get into college, regardless of which one, the pressure persists: get accepted into your major, an internship opportunity, graduate school, etc. Over time, the concept of a "grade" evolves into more than just a measure of academic progress, and students begin associating the number with their inherent skill or ability within certain subjects. It becomes part of their identity.

There are many arguments as to why our current grading system is flawed. For one, a scalar based primarily around a limited number of exam scores is not an accurate measurement of one's ability to learn and eventually be successful. Additionally, every teacher, class and school uses different curriculums and methods for grading, making an already (mostly) meaningless value even more arbitrary. When grades start being associated with one's inherent skill or interest in a subject, the issues with our current education system become apparent.

Standardized tests such as the SAT and ACT have also remained mainstream as a way to measure the relative success of students around the country. However, singly-scaled tests can never fully capture the ability or potential of a student to succeed in their interests, and are thus flawed in their approach. Students who have access to resources preparing them for the types of questions asked in these standardized tests almost always perform better than those who don't. As such, these scores have mostly become a measurement not of knowledge, intelligence or ability to learn, but of one's privilege and history of their access to educational resources.

I believe that the fundamental issue with modern education is its inability to address the most important skill in one's career and life: the ability to learn. Rather than focusing on arbitrary ratings for the dizzying array of different subjects grade school throws at you, the education system should instead present itself as an exploratory tool for finding one's interests and strengthening the ability to learn new things. The primary goal of education should be to help foster passion and meta-learning skills, NOT to "educate" students to what they are supposedly good or bad at.

For the remainder of this essay, I will explore the fundamental issues with our education and grading system and propose a better alternative. Among the many significant problems our world faces, I firmly believe that education is one of the most important with the greatest potential for widespread benefit. Since education is the bedrock for a more productive economy, well-informed political system, smarter consumer choices and even fulfillment with one's career and life as a whole, it is crucial that we find a better way to assess and develop the skills of students in order to maximize the potential output of modern society.
