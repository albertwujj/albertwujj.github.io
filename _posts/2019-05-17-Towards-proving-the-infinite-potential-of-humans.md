*Note: We are upper-middle class American citizens (or as our parents like to call it 'still working poor'), thus our perspective is heavily biased. The following is currently largely targeted toward people in similar socio-economic situations.*

People can be in 100% agreement even if everything is constructed, as long as they communicate. They just communicate their ideas/values and then both continue discussing and updating their functions until it almost (close enoughly) converges to consistent.
So not 100% as in 100% but as in as much as satisfies them individually. To elaborate on 2-person full agreement - I mean full agreement on a specific idea (in my analogy a 'state'), which then each person has to backup to be the same as each other, and still consistent with their value function of their other ideas
^ philosophically refine an idea until it's near mathematical

anxiety causing more thought is actually like a double-benefit: once it serves a purpose you let it go. It's like a variable which automatically collects itself when done - but even better - one's reason for the anxiety doesn't need to have anything to do with the thoughts it results in. It's like the pump of a well-oiled machine.

Elon musk believing everything is a simulation makes perfect sense to me now from an open-minded, first-principles standpoint and resulting ideas
Like it's the result of a human mind that can deal with both infinite, infinitesimal, meta, and no ego. Ego not as in sense of self but the negative definition that implies narrow-mindedness
I personally had always had a fear of the infinite and infinitesimal.

Want to live forever now, if we're always perfectly healthy. The initial friction against it is the misconception we have limited energy. Everything can always be improved in the limit, 
yet we can always explore, just like the 2 RL stepsize/epsilon conditions for convergence.

One may have doubts even with pure reason, but that is because they think they will forget the lessons one learned. But just like DRAM refresh is necessary. Except even better cuz of spaced repitition, refresh interval gets longer and longer. Thus (think converging power series) you can literally learn infinite with time. To make it concrete: given infinite time, if you can keep up with Anki, you can learn infinite. This can trivially be mathematically proved (after refining the hypothesis).

Hypothesis: A human can live their life without ever shutting their eyes to sleep


We learn and create new things because everyone who has ever existed has had/ has now access to what no one ever had before. Standing on the shoulders of giants. Terry Tao, for example, didn't get RL analogies
If we live forever we can literally do anything, as long as it follows the laws of physics. We can teach anyone anything as long as they also live forever.

It's good to, whatever I think, write it down before sending it to you. But gotta take risks to not write down stuff I think with high probability I won't completely forget 

I never deliberately/meta-worry about writing anymore, it's just a choice to no longer spend more time critiquing/qualifying/adding more ideas/making clearer. Similarly with decision making. My body generates anxiety but this is a benefit.

You don't need to believe humans exist to prove the stuff I'm saying

Beginning learning math is like an introduction to meta-thinking

You need to write low-friction sentences, otherwise it may not be worth the time to its readers.

Don't explain something to someone if they can explain it better to them themself

Don't overestimate your past self or underestimate your future self

No matter what I have 100% trust I can keep on spinning

Happiness is nowhere near as productive a concept as learning

The goal is to align what you want with what you want, which is fully achievable in the limit

Achieve certainty without external dependencies: You can gain confidence in the correctness of your hypotheses by telling yourself to do something and doing it

Matt Stonie is an example of unintuitive human capabilities 

Most people wouldn't even take the time to read a couple of these takes

I was anxious about ordering these takes then realized its better for us to do it together. Then we can put this in a shared blog. Now that I think about it we definitely should have a merged blog. distill.pub is a multi-author ML blog but i think we should just both claim full credit to each post on ours, on our resumes etc. Since I already have Jekyll set up we'll just use mine and i'll rename the repo/site

Maybe I was wrong and not only does real-life meta-thinking require the same techniques as Derivative Clicker, but it has the same mechanics. Compounding advantage.
