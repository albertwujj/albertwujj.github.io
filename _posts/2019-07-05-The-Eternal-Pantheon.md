> I have the feeling people like George Orwell, Ayn Rand, Vladimir Nabokov, Jane Austen, Franz Kafka, and Charles Dickens would be absolute gods today. - @albertwujj

In progress.

Twitter influencers with say 2 Million followers would be completely lost without the Internet today.

No Twitter, no email, no texting, no blogging, no web news, no nothing.

A single sentence from one of their books is better than the average Twitter influencer's tweet. And a book requires far more thought, far more creativity to write.

Fiction is a monumentally difficult task. Fiction requires the ability to get lost in your own world, an ability that is made far more difficult by the existence of the Internet. So the Internet is both the death and potential lifespring of wisdom.
