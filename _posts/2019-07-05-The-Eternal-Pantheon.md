In progress.

Twitter influencers with say 2 Million followers would be completely lost without the Internet today.

No Twitter, no email, no texting, no blogging, no web news, no nothing.

Without the Internet, without the ability to affect anyone instantaneously, the pantheon was faced with a much, much harder task. But they did not falter in the face of challenge. They, of course, had read books from hundreds of years ago. Thus, they knew that the trivial present was not the only moment they could affect. They gazed at the stars of time. (also they didn't have googling for synonyms).

A single sentence from one of the pantheon's books is better than the average Twitter influencer's tweet. And a book requires far more thought, far more creativity to write.

Fiction is a monumentally difficult task. Fiction requires the ability to get lost in your own world, an ability that is made far more difficult by the existence of the Internet. So the Internet is both the death and potential lifespring of wisdom.
