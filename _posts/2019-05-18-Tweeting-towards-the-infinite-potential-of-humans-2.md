letting oneself be either defeated by failure or diverted by applause.” -Gustav Mahler -@SouthernGemGal

In progress.

Join our club. It’s the ‘do what you want club’. You do want you want, any time, all the time. There’s infinite recursive levels of reflection to choose from. Choosing which level itself is learnable.

Eventually we will hit a dead end in human math, without immortality in the limit. Who knows, maybe we're 1% of the way there?

As you get faster anxiety loses its grip. At worst it will slow you down and calm you a little.


You don't try to bullshit theorize. You come up with new ideas and see where it all connects. Unless the math really helps people come up with better ideas, which im not so sure. you gotta test it on the real env, after all. the latest best ideas in ML have seemed extremely light on math.

If there was an essay like ours, I would've found it by now. 

Treat yourself as the same as all other variables. Practice predicting yourself

Would you rather relish in enlightenment, or help others realize the ability to achievement?

Buddhists spend their whole lifetime achieving enlightenment. Now we have the internet so just learned from all of them

You never have to think a thought you don't want to, because there's always a better choice of meta out there.

See the sadness in the world to realize we have a job. We have a much more interesting job now than optimizing our own happiness. It's so much funner.

Free thinking is what makes us human.

Humans are variables too.

Pomodoro is helpful.

I'm playing a game, but in that game I'm playing the same game. Just like turtles all the way down.

Don't just second-guess your self. Or just third-guess yourself. Second-guess your second-guess. Just choose a layer. This is how you create infinite novelty. For a stupid game see [Derivative Clicker](https://gzgreg.github.io/DerivativeClicker/).

Correcting yourself is an even more direct way to create novelty.

Just because a issue requires qualification doesn't mean you should skip over it.

Full control over our hormones.  

Cult of freedom.

If it's important, it'll come back to you.

Do you lack free will?

In order to train an RL agent, you must think like one.

With calm reflection, stress should be the greatest creativity boost.

If you figure out what's wrong, you're naturally lead to what's right.

Isolate yourself completely from social media after 10pm.

Doing what you're not necessarily sure is the right thing can create positive tension.

People are sad. One can do a lot more for other people then they can do for themself.

We can literally choose the priors for our children in the future.

@wuaaro is my best math teacher I could have ever imagined.

Positive self-reflection is stupid when you can control your hormones.

Our actions live or die on their own merits.

Because one's anxiety is helpful even if it is not accurate, one may have an overtendency to.


Qualify the decisions, then maximize the decisions. Unlike in Reinforcement Learning (see Sutton and Barto [example 13.1](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf#page=345)), in real life it is never optimal to be uncertain about an action.

It's not possible to save the world. But we will certainly try.
