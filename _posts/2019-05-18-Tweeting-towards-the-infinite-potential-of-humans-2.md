In progress.

Join our club. It’s the ‘do what you want club’. You do want you want, any time, all the time. There’s infinite recursive levels of reflection to choose from. Choosing which level itself is learnable.

Choice creates novelty and reduces boredom.

Eventually we will hit a dead end in human math, without immortality in the limit. Who knows, maybe we're 1% of the way there?

As you get faster anxiety loses its grip. At worst it will slow you down and calm you a little.


You don't try to bullshit theorize. You come up with new ideas and see where it all connects. In RL, even off-policy methods have shaky theoretical foundations. How can you claim your equations for approximate NNs on enormous datasets mean anything?

You gotta test your predictions on the real environment.

Treat yourself as the same as all other variables. Practice predicting yourself.

Would you rather relish in enlightenment, or help others realize the ability to achieve it?

Buddhists spend their whole lifetime achieving enlightenment. Now we have the internet so we just learn from all of them.

You never have to think a thought you don't want to, because there's always a better choice of meta out there.

Helping others is a much more interesting job than optimizing our own happiness.

Free thinking is what makes us human.

Humans are variables too.

Pomodoro is helpful.

I'm playing the game of life, but in that game I'm playing the same game. Games all the way down.

Don't just second-guess your self. Or just third-guess yourself. Second-guess your second-guess. Just choose a layer. This is how you create infinite novelty.

Correcting yourself is an even more direct way to create novelty.

Just because a issue requires qualification doesn't mean you should skip over it.

Full control over hormones.  

Freedom of thought.

If it's important, it'll come back to you.

Do you lack free will?

In order to train an RL agent, you must think like one.

With calm reflection, stress should be the greatest creativity boost.

If you figure out what's wrong, you're naturally lead to what's right.

Don't ruin the numinous isolation of the night.

Doing what you're not necessarily sure is the right thing can create positive tension.

People are sad. One can do a lot more for other people then they can do for themself.

We can literally choose the priors for our children in the future.

@wuaaro is my best math teacher I could have ever imagined.

Positive self-reflection is stupid when you can control your hormones.

Our actions live or die on their own merits.

Because one's anxiety is helpful even if it is not relevant, one may overestimate their intuition.


Qualify the decisions, then maximize the decisions. Unlike [in RL](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf#page=345), in real life it is never optimal to be uncertain about an action.

It doesn't seem possible to save the world. But you should certainly try.
