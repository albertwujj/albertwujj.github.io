In General Relativity, regardless of how quickly you observe light, light is still observed at the same speed by another.

Thus, there could be a Minecraft server representing a whole different world, potentially with a different set of rules, such as a strict version of the U.S. constitution. Then, in "base reality" we may decide we would no longer need a goverment. Anarchy would rule.

And Einstein's relativity would still hold.
