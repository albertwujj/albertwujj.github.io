Deus Group

Whiterose built a hospital under the Washington Township plant where they also run computational particle physics simulations for chaos theory on each patient and staff member by tracking their locations. Patients may then be renamed after relevant dimensionless quantities, once they claim to have forgotten the name they entered with.

Cixin Liu wrote extensively about the implications.
