> "If people are open-minded creating a 'human singularity' should be pretty easy. We are connected individuals of 7.7 billion. We continuously improve, not incrementally like an AI singularity would imply. And we can improve exponentially." - a dreamer



We believe everyone has limitless potential with two things: Zero external pressure. One hundred percent self-honesty. The latter follows the former, but you can't have one without the other.

Everything is constructed. Everything is an opinion. How do we even function? The answer is calm, honest, incremental communication. 

So much of creation has two orthogonal parts. In writing you have to deliberately alternate between creating and critiquing, but not both at the same time.

Anxiety resulting in more reflection/reconsideration is actually a double-benefit: once it serves a purpose you can let it go. 

Never think the same thought twice in a row. You’re literally getting 0 new information. Spaced repetition can help with receiving new random seeds when revisiting thoughts.

Believing we are in a simulation is the result of being able to deal with both the infinite, the infinitesimal, the meta, and the lack of ego.

A reduced sense of wonder is key.

[Matt Stonie](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd1fLoVFooPeWqCEYVUJZqg) is an example of unintuitive human capabilities. So is [Danielle Steel](https://www.glamour.com/story/danielle-steel-books-interview).

We learn and create new things because everyone who has ever existed has had access to what no one ever had before.

If we were immortal one could convince anyone of any of your beliefs. 

I never worry whatsover about writing anymore. It's just a choice to no longer spend more time critiquing, qualifying, or adding more ideas. Similarly with decision making.

You need to write low-friction pieces if you want to be worth the time to your readers.

Don't explain something to someone if they can explain it better to themselves.

Don't overestimate your past self or underestimate your future self.

We are galaxies orbiting black holes. Naked loneliness is a highly productive feeling. One might think it is necessary to depend on others' gravities, but really you must not fall under their influence.

Don't just give risks thought proportional to their probability times impact. Give low probability risks zero thought. Humans cannot consider that many ideas simultaneuosly. We're not neural networks.

No matter what, I have absolute belief I can keep on spinning.

Only the gradient matters.

Happiness is nowhere near as productive a concept as learning.

The goal is to align what you want with what you want, which is fully achievable in the limit.

Achieve certainty without external dependencies: You can gain confidence in the correctness of your hypotheses by telling yourself to do something and doing it. See [Paul Erdos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s) on amphetamines.

Most people wouldn't even take the time to read a couple of these texts.

Maybe I was wrong and not only does real-life meta-thinking require the same techniques as the web-game [Derivative Clicker](https://gzgreg.github.io/DerivativeClicker/), but it has the same mechanics. Compounding advantage.

When stressed about a specific external problem, dedicate discrete, incremental periods of time to analyze the problem from first principles.

Philosophically refine an idea until it's near mathematical.

2 things we have dogs don’t: We can direct action. I can arbitrarily choose to lick the table. And we have the ability to reflect/meta-think at arbitrary levels (for a stupid example see Derivative Clicker).

We absolutely have wondrous superpowers and magical gifts compared to people 100 years ago. Reflect honestly on it.

If you’re honest with yourself about the effect of technology on you, you can begin to free yourself from its grasp.

Force your priors into the ones you deeply want. In Reinforcement Learning, the value function is the prior from the perspective of an individual timestep. 

The process of recall for memory is more helpful than one might think, because in addition to storing inputs, our memory also stores intermediate computations.


Afraid to self-reflect? Feel like you're biased? Afraid nothing's real?. Try pretending you’re analyzing an alien, not a human.

Once you learn to optimize everything else, it's trivial to optimize yourself.

We have a single anecdote of a person who (we believe) shows that anything is possible: our author Albert. He failed his classes with a GPA of less than 1.0, while sitting alone every lunch. Along with his bro Aaron, he is writing this tweet.


You have the potential for a self-singularity.
