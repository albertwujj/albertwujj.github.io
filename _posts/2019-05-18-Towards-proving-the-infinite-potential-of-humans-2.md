In progress.

Join our club. It’s the ‘do what you want club’. You do want you want, any time, all the time. There’s infinite recursive levels of reflection to choose from. Choosing which level itself is learnable.

Eventually we will hit a dead end in human math, without immortality in the limit. Who knows, maybe we're 1% of the way there?

As you get faster and faster external pressure cannot touch you. At worst it will slow you down and calm you a little.


You don't try to bullshit theorize. You come up with new ideas and see where it all connects. Unless the math really helps people come up with better ideas, which im not so sure. you gotta test it on the real env, after all. the latest best ideas in ML have seemed extremely light on math.

If there was an essay like ours, I would've found it by now. 

Treat yourself as the same as all other variables. Practice predicting yourself

Would you rather relish in enlightenment, or help others realize the ability to achievement?

Buddhists spend their whole lifetime achieving enlightenment. Now we have the internet so just learned from all of them

You never have to think a thought you don't want to, because there's always a better choice of meta out there.

See the sadness in the world to realize we have a job. We have a much more interesting job now than optimizing our own happiness. It's so much funner.

Free thinking is what makes us human.

Humans are variables too.

Pomodoro is helpful.

I'm playing a game, but in that game I'm playing the same game. Just like turtles all the way down.

Don't just second-guess your self. Or just third-guess yourself. Second-guess your second-guess. Just choose one. This is how you create infinite novelty.

People are sad. We can do a lot more for other people, then we can do for ourselves.

Full control over our hormones.  

Cult of freedom.

Any pair can have what siblings have. It only requires no ego and deliberate communication.

If it's important, it'll come back to you.

Save the world/e.g. free everyone.

In order to train an RL agent, you must think like one.

Learning should not be discrete. It should be infinitesimally small in the limit

Everyone has the natural intuition for saving the world.
