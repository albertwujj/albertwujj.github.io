Why You Need To Look Twice

Everything lacks context. Everything. But this concept is key in social communication. 

What no one does is 'try out' different contexts. When someone says something to you, you guess at a couple of contexts which are most likely for them to have and for you to be missing. Then, you reflect on what they said, in those contexts.

People assume there is only one context, the one their gut instinct guesses at. If their gut instinct cannot guess at any context, then they just say they 'cannot understand' the other person.
